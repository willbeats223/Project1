Seasonality Analysis

Team Members:
Will, Hunter, Amir, Mitchell, Matt

Sectors Investigated (time-series datasets/ daily close data required for each):
- Energy
- Travel
- Apparel
- Telecoms/Consumer Electronics
- Infrastructure
AND for Baseline
- Interest Rates
- SPX or other index


Project Purpose:
To determine to what extent, if any, these sectors experience seasonality effects.

Outline:
- Choose 3-5 stocks for each sector (using more than one to slightly diversify away idiosyncratic risks)
	- Pull data for each stock for X number of years
	- Plot time-series daily returns (1 plot for each sector, individual stocks as their own series)

- Create equally-weighted portfolios by sector
	- Calculate avg weekly?monthly? returns for each portfolio.
	- Plot (bar probably?)

- Determine the following for each portfolio (StockChart Seasonality for definitions):
	- Range of Insignificance
	- Threshhold for Strong Bullish/Bearish Biases
	- Overlay these on a plot or some kind of dashboard

Research Questions:
- What sort of seasonal effects are seen in each of these portfolios/sectors over the last X years? (Brittanica Money examples)
- Are the same effects seen with the baseline securities?
